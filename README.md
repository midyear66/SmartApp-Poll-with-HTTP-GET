# SmartApp-Poll-with-HTTP-GET (ARCHIVED)
A smartapp that will poll polling() capable devices via HTTP GET.

App will text the HTTPS string to the phone of your choice for inclusion
into a shell script for use in a cron job 

I created a cron job to call group1=5min, group2=10min, group3=15 min, group4=30min
